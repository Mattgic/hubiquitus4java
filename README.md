# Hubiquitus4j - An implementation of Hubiquitus for the Java platform

Hubiquitus4j is a set of three Java components :

* Hubiquitus API : the Java bindings for the hubiquitus semantics
* Hubot SDK : a kit for Java developers allowing rapid development of hubiquitus agents called hubots
* Hubiquitus Server : the application server

Recently, Hubiquitus added three components : HTwitterAPI-1.1, HFacebook and HInstagram. That can be used independently, with a simple client.

The "HubotPack" folder content three bots sample:

* feedhubot allows to retrive data from RSS feed
* twithubot allows to retrive data from twitter
* myfirstbot allows to retrive a string and publish it on a node
* countTweetsBot allows to count messages from the hserver
