# Hubiquitus4j - An implementation of Hubiquitus for the Java platform

Hubiquitus4j is a set of three Java components :

* Hubiquitus API : the Java bindings for the hubiquitus semantics
* Hubot SDK : a kit for Java developers allowing rapid development of hubiquitus agents called hubots
* Hubiquitus Server : the application server

Recently, Hubiquitus added three components : HTwitterAPI-1.1, HFacebook and HInstagram. That can be used independently, with a simple client.

* TwitterBot allows to retrive data from twitter and post a tweets
* HFacebookBot allows to retrive data from facebook
* HInstagramBot allows to retrive data from instagram 
* HelloBot allows to retrive a string and publish it on a node
