# Required configuration
------------------------

XMPP server (We are using ejabberd)
-----------------------------------
You have to define one host (eg. myHost), one domain (eg. myDomain) and one user admin for your server.
Then, create at least two users that will be able to communicate with it :

* One for the hserver - Define the name and the password (eg. nameOfThisServerUser@mydomain and any password)
* One for each bot you want to run - Define the name and the password (eg. nameOfThisBotUser@mydomain and any password)

After that, you have to configure the hserver component into the xmpp server.

For the main node, configure the opened port with :

* The port number
* The protocle type
* The name of the module
* And options like this : 
`[{access, all}, {shaper_rule, fast},
 {host,
  "hserver.mydomain",
  [{password,
    "TheOneYouWant"}]}]`
